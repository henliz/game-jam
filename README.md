## Concept

The wind howls, ice cracks beneath your feet. Spring isn’t coming. You have been tasked with investigating why. The local wizard’s tower is meant to banish the winter and herald a new season, but the light atop it has stayed dark. Hired by the local townsfolk, you are sent to investigate the tower and figure out what happened. Read the wizard’s own notes and sift through the mess he left behind as you try and discover how to get the tower working again.

## Setting & Premise

Your story begins, as some stories do, in the winter. Though this is no ordinary winter. And yours is no ordinary task. You play as an adventurer, hired by the people of a cursed land to investigate their local wizard’s tower. 
The isolated spire normally cuts through the cold with it’s bright light, bringing forth spring. But the beacon has not shone for some time now and it's wizard nowhere to be seen. The world is locked into a seemingly never-ending winter. Cold and afraid, the local populace has hired you to investigate. Tired from a string of unfortunate adventures, you arrive at the doorstep.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. Explore the tower in first-person 3D
2. Discover objects and the wizard's scattered notes
3. Interact with items via 2.5D focused screens (cleaning, repairing, reading)
4. Solve environmental puzzles to understand how the tower works
5. Restore mechanisms floor by floor
6. Reignite the beacon and watch spring return

## Structure & Progression

**The Tower:**
- Ground floor + 2-3 interior floors + beacon chamber at the top
- Each floor contains puzzles and pieces of the narrative
- Stairs unlock when the current floor's three items are cleaned/restored (?)

**Progression:**
- Floor-by-floor exploration with escalating (does it idk I feel like a bit??) complexity
- Journal entries reveal tower systems and the wizard's story
- Environmental storytelling through object placement and decay

## Camera & Interaction

**3D First-Person Exploration**
- Navigate and discover in the atmospheric tower interior
- Stairs gate progression between floors

**2.5D Object Interaction Screens**
- Triggered when examining objects up close
- Read journals, solve mechanism puzzles, clean and restore items
- Inspired by *A Little to the Left*, *Unpacking*, and *Undusting*

**Scene Transitions** *(Jam Limitation: Overcomplicated Screen Transitions)*
- guys idk I'm writing this based on google docs things I found someone wordsmith for me
